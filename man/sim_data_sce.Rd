\description{
A short description of your dataset.
}
\details{
The \code{sim_data_sce} object is designed to serve as a teaching and development aid for methods that require complex
single-cell expression data. It includes several typical features found in single-cell datasets, such as varied levels of
gene expression and metadata describing both cells and genes.

The data within this object are entirely synthetic and should not be used for real analysis. The main use case is for
testing and development of single-cell analysis methodologies.

\references{
The data were generated using a combination of random number generation for expression values and curated sources for
metadata to simulate realistic experimental scenarios.
